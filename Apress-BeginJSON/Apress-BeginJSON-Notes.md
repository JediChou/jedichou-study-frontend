### Key Points from Chapter 1

* JavaScript is a text-based language made up of Unicode and ASCII characters.
* ECMAScript refers to the specification of the language.
* JavaScript possesses two categories of data types: primitive and non-primitive.
* Primitive values can be numbers, strings, Boolean, undefined, and null.
* undefined represents the lack of value.
* null is used to denote intentional absence of value.
* Expressions resolve to a value.
* Operators are used to fashion expressions.
* The addition operator serves two purposes.
* Strict comparison operators prevent the occurrence of type coercion.
* Non-strict comparison operators rely on type coercion before comparing two operands.
* The typeof operator is used to determine the type of datum.
* The instanceof operator is used to determine the Object type of an instance.
* Statements should be terminated explicitly.
* Statement blocks can group multiple statements.
* Identifiers are case-sensitive text-based labels.
* Functions are named blocks of code that can be provided parameters.

## Chapter 2: Special Objects

* Listing 2-1. Creation of an object.
* Listing 2-2. Dot Notation Is Used to Access a Member from an Instance.
* Listing 2-3. Bracket Notation Is Used to Access a Member from an Instance.
* Listing 2-4. Comparing Notations.
* Listing 2-5. An Ordered List of the Days of the Week.
* Listing 2-6. A for Loop Is Used to Read from an Ordered List.
* Listing 2-7. Demonstrating the String Representation of an array.
* Listing 2-8. Object Literals Can Be Designed with Members.
* Listing 2-9. undefined Assignment of internalObject.
* Listing 2-10. Moved Assignment of Instance Creation.
* Listing 2-11. Reordering of Instantiations.
* Listing 2-12. Object Literals Are Created As They Are Evaluated.
* Listing 2-13. Syntactical Representation of an Object Literal.
* Listing 2-14. Object Literal with a Key/Value Pair.
* Listing 2-15. Object Literal Designed with Multiple Key/Value Pairs.
* Listing 2-16. Syntactical Representation of an array Literal.
* Listing 2-17. array Literal Designed with a Key/Value Pair.
* Listing 2-18. Array Literal Value Obtainable via Bracket Notation.
* Listing 2-19. Array Literal Designed with Multiple Key/Value Pairs.

### Key Points from Chapter 2

* Absolutely everything is an object.
* All classifications in their most generalized form are objects.
* Object and object have two different meanings.
* Object (with an initial capital letter) refers to the JavaScript Object type.
* An object refers to an instance.
* objects are collections.
* Special Objects are collections of like-minded behaviors.
* All instances implicitly possess their ancestorsâ€™ behaviors.
* toString returns the string representation of an object.
* new is used to create instances of a non-primitive value.
* Dot notation relies on identifiers.
* Bracket notation relies on strings.
* Objects are unordered collections.
* Arrays are ordered collections.
* Literals can be instantiated with predefined key/value pairs.
* All literals are instantiated via objects behind the scenes.
* this is used to maintain the scope of the property being accessed.
