The Franco-Mongol alliance was an attempted alliance between 
Frankish Crusaders and the Mongol Empire against the Muslims, 
their common enemy. Contact between Europeans and Mongols began 
around 1220, and tended to follow a pattern: the Europeans 
asked the Mongols to convert to Christianity, while the Mongols 
(who had already conquered many Christian and Muslim nations in 
their advance across Asia) responded with demands for submission 
and tribute (example letter pictured). European attitudes began 
to change in the mid-1260s, from perceiving the Mongols as 
enemies to be feared, to potential allies against the Muslims. 
The Mongols sought to capitalize on this, promising a re-conquered 
Jerusalem to the Europeans in return for cooperation. Attempts to 
cement an alliance continued through decades of negotiations, 
without success. The Mongols invaded Syria several times between 
1281 and 1312, sometimes in attempts at joint operations with 
Crusader forces, but the forces were never able to coordinate in 
any meaningful way. The Mongol Empire eventually dissolved into 
civil war, and the Crusaders lost control of Palestine and Syria 
to the Egyptian Mamluks. (Full article...)
