					GIT v1.5.2.5 Release Notes
					==========================

					Fixes since v1.5.2.4
					--------------------

					 * Bugfixes

					   - "git add -u" had a serious data corruption problem in one
						 special case (when the changes to a subdirectory's files
						 consist only deletion of files).

					   - "git add -u " did not work from a subdirectory.

					   - "git apply" left an empty directory after all its files are
						 renamed away.

					   - "git $anycmd foo/bar", when there is a file 'foo' in the
						 working tree, complained that "git $anycmd foo/bar --" form
						 should be used to disambiguate between revs and files,
						 which was completely bogus.

					   - "git checkout-index" and other commands that checks out
						 files to the work tree tried unlink(2) on directories,
						 which is a sane thing to do on sane systems, but not on
						 Solaris when you are root.

					 * Documentation Fixes and Updates

					   - A handful documentation fixes.
